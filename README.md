# Todo Application - Frontend

This is the front end of a Todo Application, built throughout the [Tech Returners](https://techreturners.com) Your Journey Into Tech course. It integrates with a backend, available [here](https://github.com/AnnJBarr/ninetyeight_and_threequarters).

The hosted version of the application is available here: [https://AnnJBarr.github.io/ninetyeight_and_threequarters/](https://AnnJBarr.github.io/ninetyeight_and_threequarters/).

The application is called Ninety Eight & 3/4 Percent after a Dr Seuss quote. To be successful, challenges need to be broken up into steps we can take one after another, like the tasks on our to do list.

*On and on you will hike 
and I know you'll hike far 
and face up to your problems whatever they are.*

*You'll get mixed up, of course, as you already know. You'll get mixed up with many strange birds as you go. So be sure when you step. Step with care and great tact and remember that Life's a Great Balancing Act. Just never forget to be dexterous and deft. And never mix up your right foot with your left.*

*And will you succeed? Yes! You will, indeed! (98 and 3 / 4 percent guaranteed.)*

#### Oh the places youâ€™ll go - Dr Seuss

### The application has been designed to 
- show the total number of tasks awaiting completion, list of tasks to complete (sorted oldest - newest) with due date in words, a list of completed tasks (sorted newest completed - oldest completed) with done date in words. Overdue tasks show due date in red and completed tasks show details with strikethrough.  (READ)
- allow for the creation of new tasks whilst selecting a due by date. A task can not be added without text and max 160 characters available. Date selected cannot be before today. (CREATE)
- allow for tasks to be marked as completed and the completed Date added to the data object. Allow for completed tasks to be undone and completed Date removed (UPDATE)
- allow for tasks to be deleted from either to do or completed tasks (DELETE)
